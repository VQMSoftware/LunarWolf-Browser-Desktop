## Additional Grant of Patent

A perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable license, under any necessary claims, to
make, have made, use, import and otherwise transfer the Wexond software, is
hereby granted to each recipient ("you") of the Wexond software distributed by
Eryk Rakowski.

The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate
directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in.

## GPL notice:

in lines 388 to 396 of the GPLv3 license, it reads the following:

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

so: keep that license text in mind, this is a gray area to me so i will not disprove these terms.

(1) This software may not be sold to a third party nor redistributed or
    otherwise conveyed in the original form.

(2) No recipient or contributor is allowed to ask and receive any donations for
    his copy of Wexond software.

(3) A written permission from the main maintainer of Wexond software (Eryk
    Rakowski) is necessary if a recipient or contributor decides to sell or
    publish the software on official stores or intents to realize any economic
    gains.
